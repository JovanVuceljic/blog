This task is about creating simple single page app. The focus is on front-end part; you are given expected design layout (screenshots) and API that needs to be used.
API is hosted here: https://frontend-api-test-nultien.azurewebsites.net/swagger
and is using a Swagger, so hopefully it should be self-explanatory.

(Using BlogPosts & Category API) App should support CRUD operations for blog site; you can add new blog posts or alter existing ones (pop up will appear) or you can filter/delete them.
Images (with descriptions like 80x80 or 100x100) are not provided, but are expected to be there in layout so please make a placeholder for them.
Note: working with any kind of files and authentication/authorization is out of the scope for this task.
Look & feel should be similar (as much as possible) to provided screenshots.
Use HTML5 markup when you can.
You can use any of the following libraries/frameworks: Angular, React (preferred), VueJs.
You can use Bootstrap or any other styling framework in line with your custom SASS or LESS or you can perhaps write everything in plain CSS.
Make application to have responsive design.

Linting and/or (unit) testing your code is more than welcome.
It's expected that you will apply some of best coding practices you know, but this is a small exercise and you probably shouldn't spend more thand few to several hours on it.
Once you're done with coding, send us your code via email or URL to your GitHub/Bitbucket repository. Please include your source control history.
